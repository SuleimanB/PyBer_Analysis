# PyBer_Analysis

1. The purpose of this analysis is to showcase how data differs within PyBer by city type. The result of this should hopefully be that PyBer is in a better position to adjust to the three different city types (urban, suburban and rural) that they are currently serving these different environments distinctly therefore benefiting the company.

2. (Add Multiline here)

   As we can see, all three types of environments offer different volumes for both riders, drivers and total fares accrued.  We can see that the urban environment sees by far the highest amounts of volume with 1,625 rides taking place with 2,405 drivers at the time. As a result of this, the total fares of $39,854.38 showcases to us that a lot of attention and any retention for users will primarily be through the urban types of cities. On the other hand, for the Suburban environment, we can see that although volume for rides and drivers are significantly lower, average fares are higher possibly as a result of increased distances between destinations with different locations being more split apart compared to an urban environment. Lastly with the Rural the same trend can be seen with the lowest volume out of the three and the highest average fares. Pyber can make good use of these benchmarks to better understand how typical routes differ compare to one another. 

   3. For the CEO I would recommend these three points...

   - Focus primarily on refining your service for the Urban environment as they make up the highest user base compared to the other three types. 
   - For the other two types of environments (Rural, Suburban) there should still be a focus on ensuring drivers in these types of cities are able to still retain rides as they do cover more distance and therefore a solid amount of fares with these environments possibly featuring lesser amounts of alternatives compared to urban cities (public transportation, walking not as feasible, convenience of a car ride in these areas etc.) 
   - As time progresses and environments might shift in population or interest, keeping an eye out on the amount of drivers vs users will be a key point to monitor to ensure there is not an excess in supply of drivers or demand from users that could not be met. Ensuring new users and drivers have a steady growth in hand with one another will be crucial for long term stability.
